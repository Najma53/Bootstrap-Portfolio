# Bootstrap-Portfolio
As a bootcamp student, we are required to use bootstrap 4 to create a portfolio and then edit it so doesnt look like bootstrappy.

# Description
 The project required us to construct portfolio using the following criteria

    . Create a new GitHub repositories and name it `Bootstrap-Portfolio`.

    . Clone this repository to your computer.

    . Inside your `Bootstrap-Portfolio` repo, create the folder structure for the webpage.  
        - Create a `index.html`.

        - Create a `css` folder.

        - Inside create a `style.css` file.

        - Create an `images` folder.

         - Place all your images in this folder.

      

    . The website should include the following bootstrap components using bootstrap:

        - A Navigation bar
        - A jumbotron with your picture and name
        - A work section displaying work in grid format and use of card.
        - A skills section
        - List out the skills you expect to learn from the bootcamp.
        - An about / contact section.
        - A footer section.
        - All hyperlinks should have a hover effect.
        - All buttons should display a box shadow upon hover.

    . Deploy your new Bootstrap-powered portfolio to GitHub Pages.

# Getting started

Step 1

I created a new repository on my GitHub account and clone it to my computer.

Then I deployed it by using the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push my code to my GitHub repository.

I Navigated to my GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

On the Settings page, scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the main branch as my source.

This led to my webpage viral https://najma53.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio


Step 2

In index.html file, have your boiler plate first. Then visit this site on your web browser  [Bootstrap Documentation](https://getbootstrap.com/docs/4.0/getting-started/introduction/).
Once on this site, copy bootstrap CSS code and paste it in your index file  before the title tags and after meta tags. Then after that link your own style.css sheet.
After that copy the javaScript code and paste it before the body closing tag.
Then go back to bootstap documentation site and search for navbar code and once found paste it after opening body tag. 
Do same for Jumbotron code and paste it after navbar code.

By now you have tour basic layout

Step 3

I followed the criteria above and started building the site. Where cards are used as in grid system, card code was pasted from bootstrap documentation. Once the HTML was taken care off, we move to CSS 

Step 4

I went to my style.css folder and tried overwrting bootstrap code to give my own touch.

For hover effects, I used this site https://www.w3schools.com/css/tryit.asp?filename=trycss_buttons_hover

## Conclusion

This way of building portfolio was less nerve wrecking, I enjoyed it very much once I got the hang of it. I still need to attach the placeholder links to rightful project and explain about it on cards.
I hope you can recreate something you like by using this README file as a guide.
