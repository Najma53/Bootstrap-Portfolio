# Getting started

I created a new repository on my GitHub account and clone it to my computer.

Then I deployed it by using the git add, git commit, and git push commands to save and push my code to my GitHub repository.

I Navigated to my GitHub repository in the browser and then select the Settings tab on the right side of the page.

On the Settings page, scrolled down to the GitHub Pages section. Then, in the section labeled Source, select the main branch as my source.

This led to my webpage viral https://najma53.github.io/bootstrap-portfolio
